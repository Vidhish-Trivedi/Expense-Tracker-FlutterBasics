# Expense Tracker
- This is an introductory project I made while learning Flutter and Dart.
- This is a front-end application for an expense tracker.
---

## Features
- The app displays a list of expenses made by the user.
- A user can add a new expense and categorise it as one of:
  * Food
  * Travel
  * Leisure
  * Work
- A new card widget is added for each expense, and a user may dismiss them by swiping horizontally.
- The app also displays a bar chart to compare the expenses relatively, which is updated on each removal or addition of an expense.
- Light and dark themes are supported.
